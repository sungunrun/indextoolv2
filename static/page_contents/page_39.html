referential application lacks a <i>representatum</i>.35 In all cases of perceptual referrential illusion, <br>
the state’s representational content is non-veridical.<br>
<br>
In perception, each referential application is an event, or aspect of an occurrent state, at <br>
a time in the psychological system of an individual. Referential applications are <i>not ability­ <br>
general</i>. That is, they cannot be freely exercised again and again—unlike a capacity to perceive<br>
something as square. Referential applications are <i>ability­ particular</i>. They are <br>
individuated by occurrent events, not by freely repeatable competencies. They are, in that <br>
sense, <i>occurrence­ based</i>.<br>
<br>
I say that referential applications are occurrence-based, rather than flatly occurrent, <br>
because, as noted, two occurrent events can instantiate the same referential application. <br>
Then, the same referential application is a type, not an occurrent event. Referential applications<br>
in perception can be preserved in perceptual memory. Then, the representational <br>
identity of the referential application in memory is constitutively fixed by the representational<br>
identity of the referential application in perception that it preserves. For example, a <br>
referential application may be fixed by an occurrent perceptual event. The application in <br>
memory is another, later event. But it is an instance of the same referential application that <br>
occurred in the perception. The referential application is occurrence-based in that its <br>
identity depends on the initial occurrence in perception. Further events can instantiate <br>
the same referential application in perceptual memory, if and only if they are ana phor ical<br>
ly connected to the original referential application event in perception. That is, the referential<br>
representation by the second event depends entirely on that of the first event, and <br>
the causal referential route to any referent for the second event goes through the route of <br>
the first.<br>
<br>
A similar anaphoric phenomenon occurs in linguistic discourse. One person can pick <br>
out an object demonstratively. A recipient of communication from that person can take up <br>
the demonstrative pronoun in such a way is to intentionally connect to the original occurrence.<br>
Then the recipient’s demonstrative pronoun does not initiate a new referential <br>
application. It utilizes the sender’s referential application as the antecedent of the recipient’s<br>
demonstrative pronoun. The recipient’s demonstrative application event relies essentially<br>
on the sender’s for its referring. (And such anaphora, both in perception and in <br>
discourse, can occur even if the referential applications lack a referent.) In all anaphoric <br>
cases, the sender’s and recipient’s application events count as a single demonstrative application.<br>
In being tied to an initial application event anaphorically or pronominally, the <br>
recipient’s application event has the same semantical function and semantical power. That <br>
fact grounds taking the two events as instances of one referential application.<br>
<br>
If a referential application <i>a</i> actually refers to a particular entity <i>x</i>, then no actual referential<br>
application <i>a1</i> that does not refer to <i>x</i> can be the same referential application, <i>a</i>. If a <br>
thought or perception functions in such a way as to represent or treat referential applications<br>
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> as referring to the same particular <i>x</i>, then even if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> do in fact refer to <i>x</i>, <br>
they are different applications. The thought or perception that functions to treat them as <br><br>

<b>FN 35</b>35 I distinguish perceptual referential illusions from hallucinations. <i>Perceptual referential illusions</i> are referential<br>
failures that derive from non-pathological formation of a perceptual state from proximal stimulation of the <br>
retinal receptors. <i>Hallucinations</i> are referential failures that have primarily internal causes. Although they may <br>
involve use of perceptual competencies, they are not formed through the normal channels of the perceptual system.<br>
They do not derive primarily from proximal stimulation of visual receptors. Both perceptual referential <br>
illusions and hallucinations are forms of reference failure.</div><div id="PGHEADER">
