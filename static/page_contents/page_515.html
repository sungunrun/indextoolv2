Structure of Conation in Relatively Primitive Action 515</div>

respect to the shoulder, together with specification of the two angles that define the angle <br>
of the forearm with respect to the elbow, suffice to specify the location of the hand with <br>
respect to the shoulder, since the lengths of the parts of the arm are constant.<br>
<br>
Second, the system must produce a representation of the difference between the position<br>
of the hand and the position of the target. Since the visual system is dominant in <br>
mapping the action, the specification of hand position that derives from proprioception <br>
and other perceptual sources must be translated into a specification of the hand’s position <br>
within the spatial coordinate system with a visual anchor, say the cyclopean eye, the midway<br>
point between the two eyes.694<br>
<br>
Third, the system must issue a motor command that gets the hand to follow a trajectory <br>
that begins with its initial position and ends at the target. This stage involves computation <br>
of a <i>difference vector</i>, a straight-line involving distance and direction from hand position <br>
to target.695 Both the difference vector and the target-object’s position—the end position <br>
of the movement—are represented in a motor command.696 The difference vector is the <br>
basis for the motor command. The motor command could command traversal of the vector<br>
in many ways, because there are many degrees of freedom for getting the hand to move <br>
by moving the arm. Which of these ways is caused depends on several cost-benefit factors, <br>
to which I shall return.<br>
<br>
Much of the experimentation on the structure and content of the psychology of relatively<br>
primitive action centers on perturbations of relations between key psychological <br>
subsystems. For example, perception of the results of an action might be distorted by <br>
channeling perception through a prism. The agent’s response over time is studied. Or perception<br>
might be left undisturbed, but a perturbation on the motor movement might be <br>
introduced. A normal movement of a hand might be biased so as to leave the hand (or an <br>
effector, such as a cursor, controlled by the hand) at some remove from where the same <br>
initiating movement would ordinarily take it. Or some distortion of the relation between <br>
different perceptual modalities might be introduced. Adaptation to such abnormal circumstances<br>
illumines the capabilities involved in normal action. Adaptation to normal <br>
perturbations is also a central topic of study. Noise in the psychological system is a normal,<br>
indeed inevitable, perturbation. Fatigue and aging are other normal perturbations <br>
that require adaptation of relations among perceptual, conative, retentive, and anticipatory<br>
states. Limitations on space and on my own knowledge prevent a survey of the enormously<br>
complex literature.<br><br>
