The book is resolutely a work in philosophy of science—specifically philosophy of <br>
psych ology. Perceptual psychology, centrally the psycho-physics of vision, has become a <br>
mature science in the last fifty years. It gives philosophy an opportunity to understand <br>
important features of psychological capacities at a level of depth, rigor, and empirical <br>
groundedness that has never before been attainable. Philosophy should leap at the opportunity<br>
to make use of such a powerful and rapidly advancing science, as a basis for philosophical<br>
understanding. Some philosophy of perception makes no use at all of perceptual <br>
psychology. Much philosophy of perception makes at best decorative use. I think that it is <br>
no longer intellectually responsible to philosophize about perception without knowing <br>
and seriously engaging with that science. I believe that the practice of centering philosophical<br>
reflection about perception on phenomenology, or on analysis of ordinary talk <br>
about perception, without closely connecting the reflection with what is known from science<br>
(a centering that is a residue of the early empiricist model of perception), and the <br>
practice of allowing epistemology to guide reflection on what perception must be like, will <br>
all soon become museum pieces of past, misdirected philosophy.<br>
<br>
Most of the book’s claims are, of course, supported only empirically, by interpreting the <br>
empirical results of the science. Some of the claims are, however, supported apriori. One <br>
should not confuse apriority with innateness, certainty, obviousness, infallibility, dogmatism,<br>
unrevisability, or even immunity from revision based on empirical considerations. <br>
To be apriori supported, or apriori warranted, is to have support or warrant that does not <br>
depend for its force on perception or on sensing. Most apriori warranted judgments in <br>
this book are warranted by reflection that yields understanding of key concepts or principles<br>
used or presupposed in the science. All the relevant apriori judgments are synthetic, <br>
certainly in the sense of being non-vacuous and the sense of not being truths of logic. <br>
I think that the judgments are also synthetic in the sense of not being the products of analysis<br>
of conceptual complexes into concepts contained in the complexes. I think that most <br>
concepts that are central to our discussion are not complexes. They are simple. They are, <br>
however, necessarily and apriori embedded in networks with other concepts. Reasoning <br>
through such networks sometimes yields synthetic apriori understanding of foundations <br>
of mind.<br>
<br>
Apriori supported judgments can be further supported empirically, by the science. But <br>
insofar as they are apriori warranted, they have sufficient warrant to support belief; and <br>
the warrant derives from reasoning or understanding, independently of support from perception,<br>
perceptual experience, or sensory registration. An example of an apriori warranted<br>
judgment, I think, is that perceptual states can be accurate or inaccurate. Another <br>
example is that perceptual states have a representational function—to accurately pick out <br>
and characterize particulars via causal relations to them: perceptual states fail in some way <br>
(representationally) if they are not accurate. I doubt that one can know apriori that any <br>
individual <i>has</i> perceptual capacities. Our empirical knowledge that we do have such <br>
capacities is, however, firm. It is more certain than some things that we know apriori about <br>
perception. As noted, being apriori does not imply some super-strong type of support. <br>
Apriori warrant for belief in simple arithmetical truths <i>is</i> super-strong. But much apriori <br>
support is not stronger, often less strong, than strong empirical support.<br>
<br>
Our firm empirical knowledge that individuals <i>have</i> perceptual states does not require a <br>
detailed, reflective, philosophical understanding of what perception is. Knowing that individuals<br>
have perceptual states requires only a minimal understanding. One must be able to xiv preface</div>
