Preface<br><br>
This book is not the one that I set out to write over eleven years ago. I had intended to follow<br>
<i>Origins of Objectivity</i> with an account of what is distinctive about the main representational<br>
capacity more advanced than perception. I thought, and still think, that that <br>
capacity is propositional representation. I took some steps in that direction in the Petrus <br>
Hispanus Lectures, Lisbon, 2009, and the Nicod Lectures, Paris, 2010, and developed an <br>
argument for connecting propositionality, constitutively, with propositional deductive <br>
inference. I remain interested in that other book, and hope to complete it. But it was <br>
pre-empted.<br>
<br>
In writing a lead-up to discussing propositional capacities, I wanted to elaborate an <br>
account of perception. Perception is, I think, the first representational capacity to evolve. It <br>
is the main pre-propositional representational capacity. The lead-up was intended to be a <br>
relatively concise refinement of the account of perception in the last chapters of <i>Origins of <br>
Objectivity</i>, a refinement that now occupies approximately Chapters 1–3 of this book.<br>
<br>
I became interested in vision just before I spent a semester teaching at the Massachusetts <br>
Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1982. My interest resulted in part from reading David <br>
Marr’s important book, <i>Vision</i>. Although Marr died before I arrived at MIT, I audited <br>
courses in perceptual psychology by Marr’s former colleagues during the visit. I later wrote <br>
some articles on vision and made it a central theme of <i>Origins of Objectivity</i> (2010). <br>
During work on that book and later, I benefitted from discussions of vision science with <br>
my son, Johannes Burge, who is currently a vision scientist at the University of <br>
Pennsylvania. After 2010, I came to understand the science more thoroughly, and developed<br>
ideas about structural and semantical issues associated with perception; I did so <br>
through giving a series of graduate seminars at University of California Los Angeles <br>
(UCLA), and through discussing the science with various scientists—especially in person <br>
with David Brainard, Bill Geisler, and Shimon Ullman, and via correspondence with <br>
Jeffrey Schall and Yaffa Yeshurun—and with Ned Block, one of few philosophers who serious<br>
ly engages with the science. In writing the refinement of the <i>Origins</i> account of visual <br>
perception, I soon realized that I had too much material to present in a run-up to another <br>
topic, in a single book. The preliminary became the whole.<br>
<br>
The book is about first form of representational mind. I take perception to be the most <br>
primitive type of representational mind. Relevant <i>first form</i> is three-fold.<br>
<br>
One type of <i>first form</i> is the representational structure of perception. Here, first form is <br>
the first representational form that emerges in the evolution of representational mind. <br>
This form is center-stage in Chapters 1–9. I had the main ideas about this structure when I <br>
wrote <i>Origins</i>, but I discovered much more in thinking through its details, applying it to <br>
cases, developing a semantics for it, and reflecting on how it is embedded in the iconic <br>
format of perception.<br>
<br>
A central theme in the book, centered in Parts I and II, is developing the foundations <br>
for a systematic semantics for perceptual states. Perceptual psychology takes perceptual <br>
states to be accurate or inaccurate. One of its main aims is to explain, causally, how </div>
