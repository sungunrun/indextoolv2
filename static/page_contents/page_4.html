life-cycles, ecology have no place in physics or chemistry. They are central to biology. The <br>
historical study of evolution and a lesser emphasis on law, are foreign to physics and <br>
chemistry. These scientific differences signal subject-matter differences. The living are <br>
very different from the rest.<br>
<br>
A key aspect of life, lacking in the lifeless natural world, is <i>function</i>. Rock and fire have <br>
no functions in themselves. <i>Biological</i> functions are patterns of operation whose existence <br>
derives from their contributions to success in reproduction.1 The function of photosynthesis<br>
is to convert light energy into chemical energy that subsequently is transformed <br>
in a way that feeds an organism’s other operations. The process exists in plants and other <br>
organisms because it contributed to their reproduction. It was naturally selected.<br>
<br>
Like other types of function, biological function is conceptually linked with doing well, <br>
being successful. These types of goodness are not moral, or products of plans or purposes. <br>
They are good for the system, or individual, or species, because they aid survival long <br>
enough to reproduce. Being a biological function is an objective matter: functions are <br>
what they are independently of whether anyone recognizes them. They are open to ob jective<br>
evaluation, even scientific evaluation, by rational standards. Whether and to what <br>
degree a process fulfills one of its functions can be empirically assessed. Either a process <br>
functions well or it does not.<br>
<br>
Some functions are attributable to plants and animals as whole organisms. Others are <br>
attributed only to subsystems or parts of a plant or animal. For example, functions to grow <br>
and reproduce are functions of the whole plant. By contrast, production of pollen grains is <br>
a function of the anther in a plant’s flower. Photo-synthesis is an operation in each individual<br>
cell. The whole plant, its sub-systems, and its parts can succeed or fail in realizing <br>
their functions.<br>
<br>
Functional processing in plants responds in ways sensitive to the environment. Photosynthesis<br>
depends on features of the plant that are specialized to be sensitive to light. <br>
Photo-synthesis yields responses, such as directional growth, that depend on chemical <br>
reactions in the plant that transform the light’s energy into chemical energy. These are <br>
antecedents of sensing and action that occur in animals. I think it well to follow common <br>
sense in thinking that these are not strictly cases of sensing or acting. I say that plants are <br>
<i>sensitive</i> to the environment, whereas animals <i>sense</i> it. Animals, but not plants, act. <br>
Directional growth and pollination are not actions. A plant’s absorption of water and <br>
nutrients is not drinking or eating. The Venus Fly Trap’s engulfing of visitors is not eating. <br>
I conjecture that this is so because the relevant changes in the plant can be too easily <br><br>

<b>FOOTNOTES</b><br>
<b>FN 1</b>1 This conception of biological function derives from L. Wright, ‘Functions’, <i>The Philosophical Review</i> 82 <br>
(1973), 139–168. There are other, compatible notions of function that figure in biology. I use Wright’s because <br>
it is familiar, explanatory, and teleological. Other conceptions of function in biology also take teleology serious<br>
ly and are not as centered in evolutionary history—so-called organizational conceptions. A revision of the <br>
Wright account of function, which I think of as an expansion of it, rather than purely a correction of it, centers<br>
on any contributions to reproduction within a living system, rather than purely on original-etiological <br>
contributions. For excellent work on this conception of function, see G. Schlosser, ‘Self-Reproduction and <br>
Functionality: A Systems-Theoretical Approach to Teleological Explanation’, <i>Synthese</i> 16 (1998), 303–354; <br>

Teleological?’, <i>Synthese</i> 194 (2017), 1089–1114. See also J. Garson, <i>A Critical Overview of Biological Functions</i> <br>
(Dordrecht: Springer, 2016). Although I use Wright’s notion, the notion of biological function that I rely on does <br>
not need to be specific enough to choose between these conceptions. Any scientifically based explanatory notion <br>
of teleology will suffice.</div>
