In Part III, I recommend the prologue at the beginning of Chapter 10 and the first and <br>
last sections of that chapter (What Are First-Formed Perceptual States <br>
Like?: Three Limitative Views and Two Types of First-Formed <br>
Perception). In Chapter 11, I recommend the prologue and the first section (Two <br>
Changes in Scientific Understanding of Perception-Formation). The <br>
second section is a brief run-through of the course that visual processing takes in the <br>
brain. The main points will be familiar to any vision scientist. The remaining sections provide<br>
basic facts about timing and about perceptual categorization. They may be skimmed <br>
or skipped by those seeking only gist. All these sections in Chapter 11 are mainly descriptive—with<br>
some improvements, I think, in conceptual rigor—of facts familiar to many <br>
vision scientists. Chapter 12 has a methodological discussion of considerations that bear <br>
on whether an attributive is, or should be, considered a perceptual attributive—an attributive,<br>
or characterizer, generated in the visual system (Methodology for Finding <br>
Perceptual Attributives). That section tries to codify and state more precisely <br>
methods already in place in the science.<br>
<br>
Part IV treats the visual system at a level of generality far from the focused empirical <br>
studies that make up most of the science. The prologue for Chapter 13 is recommended. It <br>
sets the plan of Part IV. Readers trying for an overview can pick and choose within, or <br>
skip, Chapters 13–18. These chapters discuss categorization, conation, attention, various <br>
forms of short-term memory, long-term memory, affect, learning, anticipation, and <br>
im agin ing. The chapters develop the idea that all these capacities have functions at the <br>
representational level of perception. As noted, the notion of <i>level</i> is explained briefly in <br>
Chapter 1 and in more detail at the beginning of Chapter 13. The chapters are part of an <br>
extended argument that the perceptual-level functions and operations of these capacities <br>
occur within the visual system or the visuomotor system, in a specific sense of ‘occur <br>
within’. Chapter 19 can be read by sampling the beginning of each section, then determining<br>
how much further to read. Chapter 19 uses work in Chapters 13–18 to develop the <br>
idea that the perceptual system—for which the visual system is paradigmatic—and the <br>
perceptual-motor system are lower representational mind. A proposal for understanding <br>
the unity of lower representational mind is advanced in A Computational <br>
Construal of Modularity. Although I explore some intermediate territory in <br>
What Should Count as Cognition?, I think that lower representational mind <br>
contrasts most dramatically with capacities for propositional inference and language, the <br>
more primitive of which constitute the first capacities in upper representational mind. I <br>
believe that the most important feature of upper representational mind is competence to <br>
produce explanations. This capacity develops into science, moral thinking and practice, <br>
and, most broadly, into understanding. The section The Empiricist Model of <br>
Perception and Cognition: Degrees of Abstraction brings together criticisms,<br>
which recur throughout the book, of an old way of thinking about the relation <br>
between perception and thought that, while not prevalent in psycho-physics of perception,<br>
remains widespread in other parts of psychology and in philosophy. This section <br>
might be useful to psychologists as well as philosophers. Chapter 20 summarizes main <br>
themes, and concludes.<br>
