My immediate family—sons and wife—has supported and taken interest. I am especially<br>
grateful to my wife, Dorli, for patience in understanding her often distracted husband<br>
and for helping me to look more carefully at the world, especially appreciating details <br>
and finding joy in the beauties of little things.<br><br>
