424 Intra-Saccadic Perception and Recurrent Processing</div>
<br><br>
A constant issue in scientific discussions of perceptual categorization is whether an <br>
abstract category, like animal-body, is really applied, or whether <i>only</i> a grouping of lowerlevel<br>
properties (“features”), such as combinations of color, texture, types of movement, <br>
and shapes, is applied. The lower-level properties usually occur when the categoryinstance<br>
occurs.<br>
<br>
The main perceptual categorizations must be cued by attributions of <i>some</i> lower-level <br>
properties. One cannot just see something as a body or a face without using shape, size, <br>
motion, texture, or color cues. Lower-level attributions of shape and size are made whenever<br>
categorizing attributions of <i>body</i> or <i>face</i> are made. The former comprise the <i>application<br>
base</i> of the latter. Attributives are representational capacities. If one is to be justified in <br>
taking a perceiver to engage in categorization, one must find some capacity beyond that of <br>
attributing the application base.<br>
<br>
Scientists are acutely aware of the issue. Experiments often aim to rule out reduction of <br>
a proposed categorization to lower-level attributions. Sometimes, experiments are fashioned<br>
to deflate a proposed categorization in favor of attribution of lower-level features. <br>
I believe that many experiments in each direction are not rigorous enough to be con vincing.<br>
Still, I think that it is impossible to undermine all experiments that postulate perceptual<br>
categorization, by postulating only perceptual attributions of lower-level features. <br>
Attributions of <i>body</i> are distinguished from attributions of lower-level features by showing <br>
that there is a disposition to anticipate certain temporal continuities. Other cat egor izations<br>
apply to sub-classes of bodies, distinguished by characteristic shape.526 Primate categor<br>
iza tion is prominently supported in the infero-temporal cortex (IT), though it is also <br>
supported by other brain regions, temporal and otherwise.527<br>
<br>
Let us return to Thorpe’s discovery of ultra-rapid categorization. Humans can visually <br>
detect whether or not something is an animal-body in circa 90 ms after the onset of a very <br>
brief stimulus exposure. Detection of faces is slightly faster, circa 80 ms. Detection of <br>
reptile-bodies occurs in 70 ms.<br>
<br>
These results are for an initial, dominantly feed-forward process. Feedback from the <br>
parietal, orbital-pre-frontal and pre-frontal areas figures in later, consolidation stages. <br>
Arrival of such feedback comes by 140–180 ms.528 Such feedback often reinforces the initial<br>
response. I know of no evidence that even this feedback initially provides information <br>
sufficiently detailed to recognize the same object again, though for very familiar objects <br>
this result seems likely. <i>Detailed</i> categorization by shape occurs yet later in perceptual <br><br>
