Methodology for Finding Perceptual Attributives 443</div>

of numerosity and its application base. No one could adapt to, sense, or perceive, number <br>
or numerosity <i>by itself</i>—any more than one could perceive danger, or body, or agency, or <br>
causation, as such, by itself. In the numerosity case, what are sensed are ensembles of <br>
en tities that are differentiated by their generic shape—by closed outer boundaries. <br>
Numerosities are properties of ensembles of such entities. Attributions of numerosity via <br>
perception necessarily have an application base whose instances are perceived by perceptually<br>
attributing to them some other property (here generic shape). Numerosity could <br>
still be attributed by a perceptual attributive that indicates <i>numerosity</i>. If so, it is attributed <br>
via visually perceiving particulars as having shape properties—properties other than <br>
<i>numerosity</i>. Showing attributives of numerosity to be perceptual requires more than showing<br>
that they adapt.<br>
<br>
None of this is to deny that adaptation is a good tool in investigating sensory and sensedependent<br>
representational capacities. As adaptation is better understood, it may become <br>
more important in helping to determine the lowest representational level at which a property<br>
is attributed. Already, a fair amount is known about how low-level perceptual attributives<br>
and information registrations adapt. For example, adaptation in the earliest cortical <br>
area of visual processing, V1, requires longer exposures than adaptation in more advanced <br>
areas. Visual processing in V1 shows adaptation, in conscious subjects, only after ex posures<br>
of 500 ms. Advanced stages of perception-formation can exhibit adaptation after <br>
exposures of 150 ms. These advanced stages center on large-scale features that ground <br>
shape-representation application bases for most higher-level attributions, like those for <br>
<i>body</i> and <i>cause</i>, including perceptual and conceptual attributions.565 Distinctions among <br>
adaptation rates can help show at what processing stage adaptation occurs. Since higherlevel<br>
attributives tend to be global, adaptation relevant to their perceptually based applications<br>
can be distinguished from local adaptation that <i>affects</i> higher-level attribution (by <br>
anger or evil intent), but does not operate directly on it. Such timing evidence may come <br>
to help determine whether a given attribute is indicated by a perceptual attributive.<br>
<br>
There is already some evidence that <i>combining</i> evidence about adaptation with evidence <br>
about timing can help determine a level at which attribution of numerosity occurs. There <br>
is evidence that there is response to numerosity in V3 at approximately 150 ms after stimulus<br>
onset—probably on second-pass stimulation of V3.566<br>
<br>
Such evidence may support the view that attribution of numerosity occurs at least as <br>
low as the perceptual level. However, I believe that there is much that we do not know <br>
about these matters. For example, there is some reason to believe that the most primitive <br>
responses to numerosity are not representational at all—are responses to retinal ensembles<br>
of retinal units with closed outer boundaries. If that is true, numerosity responses are <br>
not <i>essentially</i> representational. Responses to numerosity may occur pre-representationally <br>
and at various levels of representation.567 My point is that adaptation is not a stand-alone <br>
tool for determining the first representational level at which a property is attributed. <br>
Effects of sensory adaptation percolate upward and show up in perceptual concepts and in <br><br>
