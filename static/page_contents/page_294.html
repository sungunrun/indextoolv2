application bases. They are applied via attributives in their application bases, which are <br>
always more specific—iconic shape, size, motion, or color attributives. The <i>application <br>
base</i> is the range of specific attributives that trigger application of the generic ones that <br>
indicate the common attribute. (For more on application bases, see Chapter 11, the section<br>
Categorization and Timing and Chapter 12, the section Methodology <br>
for Finding Perceptual Attributives.) For example, one can perceive something<br>
as a generic body only by perceiving a specific shape of a specific size at a specific <br>
depth and orientation. The specific attributives in an application base are always iconic. <br>
The specific identity of the <i>generic</i> attributives on any given occasion of attribution <br>
depends on their iconic modes of presentation. Their modes of presentation partly derive <br>
from modes of presentation of attributives in their application bases. They differ from <br>
their application bases in entering into different grouping linkages. So despite its variety of <br>
levels of abstractness, perception is always iconic, broadly image-like.<br>
<br>
It can seem, as it does to many who take the traditional introspectionist-empiricist <br>
approach to perception, that perceptual categorization cannot be iconic. Sometimes it is <br>
said that categorizations and attributions of functions (<i>edible</i>) are like non-iconic linguistic<br>
labels on maps. It is noted, from introspective observation, that much perceptual categor<br>
iza tion groups in ways that do not conform to intuitive image-similarity. Some <br>
generic bodies can seem imagistically very dissimilar from others. Similarly, for faces. <br>
Representing particulars as bodies or faces can seem not image-like enough to be iconic. <br>
I think this reasoning confused. Perceptual categorizations of faces and bodies are <br>
always iconic.<br>
<br>
The groupings that ground and trigger face and body categorizations, at least in vision, <br>
necessarily use shape attributions, that are iconic. The most specific shape attributive in <br>
any given perceptual state is plotted in an image-like way on a spatio-temporal grid. That <br>
specific shape attributive is grouped with attributives of other specific shapes that the perceptual<br>
system is capable of exercising. Any given categorization—for example, a cat egoriza<br>
tion for <i>body</i>—is triggered by one specific shape attributive in the larger grouping of <br>
shape attributives that form the application base for attributives that indicate <i>body</i>. The <br>
specific categorizing attributive’s mode of presentation will involve that of the relatively <br>
specific shape attributive that triggers it. The body is seen via an iconic representation of <br>
its shape. So the categorizer is iconic. A <i>body</i> categorizing attributive is grouped with other <br>
attributives for <i>body</i>. The grouping corresponds to the grouping of underlying shape <br>
attributives that form the application base for applying all the many categorizing attributives<br>
that indicate <i>body</i>. The categorizing attributives are just as iconic as the shape attributives<br>
(by making essential use of them). The perceptual categorizing attributives differ <br>
from the shape attributives in being associated with further <i>capacities</i>—competencies for <br>
<i>use—</i>not in being non-iconic.<br>
<br>
For example, representing something as a body in a given stimulus situation involves <br>
having grouped the specific shape attributive through which the particular body is per ceptual<br>
ly represented in response to that stimulus with other shape attributives in the application<br>
base for categorizations that are linked in indicating <i>body</i>. The categorizing <br>
attributives differ from the corresponding shape attributives in having capacities to associate<br>
those shape attributives with uses and functions that go beyond representing shape. <br>
The further uses and functions differentiate the content of a given body attributive from <br>
the content of the shape (size, motion) attributive(s) on which its attributions of <i>body</i> <br>
depends. Each categorizing attributive that indicates <i>body</i> gets its iconic nature from the </div>
