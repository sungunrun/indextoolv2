Yet the science has paid no serious attention to these issues—specifically to semantics. It <br>
has not developed a vocabulary or set of principles that enable it to discuss accuracy and <br>
inaccuracy of perception with the precision and clarity of its accounts of causal, formational<br>
aspects of psychological states and processes. It provides no answers to questions <br>
like ‘What is it for a perceptual state to be accurate or inaccurate?’, ‘What sorts of representational<br>
competencies are involved in forming a state that is accurate or inaccurate?’; ‘In <br>
what ways can a perception be partly accurate and partly inaccurate?’; ‘What is the representational<br>
form or structure of perceptual states?’. Such questions are addressed in Parts I <br>
and II of the book.<br>
<br>
Scientific understanding of perception is incomplete if it does not incorporate a systematic<br>
semantical understanding of perceptual states into its understanding of principles <br>
according to which perceptual states are causally generated. Semantical understanding is <br>
understanding of the representational contents, their forms, and their accuracy conditions—the<br>
conditions for representational success. Perceptual psychology would benefit <br>
from mastering the vocabulary necessary to think systematically about the semantics of <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
Philosophy is the source of modern work in semantics—first the semantics of math emat<br>
ics and logic, later the semantics of natural language. The basic semantical concepts, in <br>
something like their modern form, come from Gottlob Frege, about 130 years ago. In the <br>
last section of Chapter 1, I explain some of Frege’s basic concepts. I think that these concepts,<br>
with some modification, are valuable in understanding perception, even though <br>
they were first developed for understanding much higher-level representation—representation<br>
in mathematics.<br>
<br>
I think that parts of the science need not only a deeper grip on semantics, but a much <br>
more rigorous terminology. Uses of terms like ‘representation’, ‘knowledge’, ‘cognition’, <br>
‘recognition’, ‘judgment’, ‘belief’, ‘concept’, ‘prediction’, ‘intention’, ‘voluntary’ are far from <br>
reflective, much less standardized, in the science. Assimilating the whys and wherefores of <br>
terminology, is often the beginning of better, more fruitful empirical inquiry. Centrally, in <br>
Chapter 19, the section Uses and Misuses of the Term ‘Cognition’, but also <br>
throughout the book, there is a concerted effort to emphasize sharper uses of key mentalistic<br>
terms so as to respect basic differences in representational level. Such differences correspond<br>
to important differences in representational kinds—that is, representational <br>
capacities.<br>
<br>
This is a long, complex book. Understanding anything well requires effort and patience. <br>
Genuine philosophical and scientific understanding cannot be grabbed off the shelf. The <br>
time and effort required to understand this book will be considerable. One cannot get <br>
there in a few sittings. The key point is to read and reread carefully and slowly, noting and <br>
reflecting on nuances and qualifications, mastering terminology, reading in context, connecting<br>
different contexts together, reading the footnotes, going back to earlier passages—<br>
all the while, reflecting. Few readers outside philosophy ever read this way. Most <br>
philosophers have, I think, lost the art. Iris Murdoch, in harmony with the marvelous <br>
quote that heads Chapter 1, wrote: ‘In philosophy, the race is to the slow’. Too many race at <br>
high speeds. The psychological and sociological pressures to form opinions and publish <br>
them quickly, and often, are very strong. Academic pressures and computer fluency have <br>
yielded much more writing, with no more time to master the increasingly complex topics <br>
written about. Careless reading, misdirected criticism, uninformed opinions, simplistic xvi preface</div>
