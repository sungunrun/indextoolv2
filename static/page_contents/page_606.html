606 Perceptual Memory: Short-Term Systems</div>
<br><br>
Plausibly, though not obviously, non-linguistic, iconic CSTM representation includes <br>
both perceptual attributives and their conceptualizations. Separating them requires finergrained<br>
experimental tools than is afforded by current use of the RSVP methodology. <br>
There is reason to think that CSTM, like working memory, retains conceptual attributives <br>
that are not conceptualizations of perceptual attributives. Verbally expressed concepts like <br>
the natural-kind concept camel are not conceptualizations of perceptual attributives.<br>
<br>
Conceptualizations of perceptual attributives for body and shape incorporate the same <br>
psychological capacities that the underlying perceptual attributives mark, and embed <br>
those capacities in a network of propositional capacities, including propositional inference.937<br>
So it is likely, given the fact that CSTM can retain verbally expressed categories, <br>
that it integrates these categories with conceptualizations of perceptual categorizations. <br>
The perceptual categorizations can thereby be activated (before the sequence of pictures is <br>
presented) by non-iconic words (‘camel’). Priming the perceptual categorizations by noniconic<br>
concepts that the words express probably proceeds via those concepts’ associative <br>
connections with iconic conceptualizations of perceptual categorizations and via associative<br>
connections between those conceptualizations and the counterpart perceptual categor<br>
iza tions. It could also occur through direct associations between the non-iconic <br>
concepts (such as camel) and perceptual categorizations for camel-bodies.<br>
<br>
CSTM almost surely contains perceptual concepts as well as verbally expressed, noniconic<br>
concepts. It certainly contains perceptual attributives that categorize as well as perceptual<br>
attributives that indicate colors and shapes. For example, CSTM retains (a) an <br>
iconic perceptual attributive that indicates <i>camel-body</i>, (b) an iconic conceptual attributive <br>
that conceptualizes the perceptual attributive and that also indicates <i>camel-body</i>, and (c) a <br>
verbally expressed non-iconic concept for <i>camel</i>. Perceptual attributives and conceptual <br>
attributives that conceptualize them are different competencies. The latter, but not the former,<br>
are competencies that function constitutively to contribute to a network of prop osition<br>
al capacities.<br>
<br>
Since many of the memories in CSTM result from activation of long-term memory <br>
contents, including conceptual contents through associations with perceptual contents, it <br>
is not surprising that both types of content—conceptual and perceptual—are retained <br>
in CSTM.<br>
<br>
Let us reflect further on the presence of both conceptual and perceptual representation <br>
in CSTM. Some of the memories are primed by words. Words’ contents are conceptual, <br>
since words function to contribute to propositional structures. The presented words for <br>
cue-targets activate concepts present in long-term memory, before the rapid sequence of <br>
pictures is shown. The parallels, earlier discussed, between CSTM and memory of word <br>
sequences, suggest that the verbally expressed, non-iconic concepts themselves are present <br>
in CSTM. In any case, they prime perceptual attributives (including perceptual cat egor izations)—either<br>
through non-linguistic perceptual concepts or directly. The perceptual <br>
attributives prime CSTM of picture representations.<br>
<br>
Suppose that CSTM and working memory contain interactions between perceptual and <br>
conceptual representations and that both types of memory contain symbolic and iconic <br>
representations. Such a situation would suggest that these memory systems may be <i>loci</i> <br><br>
