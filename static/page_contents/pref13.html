Again, the relevant perceptual-level species are perception-guided conation, perceptualattention<br>
initiations (or attention commands), perceptual memory, perceptual affect, perceptual<br>
learning, perceptual anticipation, and perceptual imagining.<br>
<br>
I think that these two large, overlapping systems—the perceptual system and the <br>
perceptual-motor system—constitute the natural-kind center of lower representational <br>
mind. I conjecture that variants of these systems, sometimes perhaps omitting one or two <br>
of the auxiliary capacities—such as perceptual imagining—or adding other auxiliary <br>
capacities—like amodal mapping—occur in all animal perceivers, from insects to human <br>
beings. These systems and the perceptual-level capacity-species are discussed in Chapters <br>
13–19, focusing on visual perception and visually guided action.<br>
<br>
The three notions of <i>first form</i> are associated with the general plan of the book. Parts I <br>
and II discuss what perception is. Part III centers on how perception works—how it is <br>
formed and the nature and scope of its processing. Part IV treats relations between perception<br>
and satellite capacities, and wherein they form a unified perceptual system and <br>
perceptual-motor system.<br>
<br>
A further theme runs through nearly all parts of the book. The theme is opposition—<br>
sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit—to a way of thinking about perception started by <br>
the classical empiricists, Locke and Hume. In trying to understand the main features of <br>
perception, this approach takes too seriously intuitive groupings and senses of similarity <br>
via introspection of conscious perceptual experience. It also errs by distinguishing perception<br>
from conception primarily in terms of differences in abstraction. Perception is supposed<br>
to operate toward the concrete end. Conception, toward the abstract end. The <br>
spectrum is intuitive—not very carefully explained. My opposition is centered in reflecting<br>
on the explanatory practice of perceptual psychology. It also derives from reflecting on <br>
the form, content, function, capacities, and uses that turn up in systematic explanation—<br>
causal and semantical.<br>
<br>
As with language, so with perception, understanding representational form and content <br>
depends not on introspection of intuitively salient features of the vehicle of representation <br>
(sentence or image-like-representation), but on competencies that underlie <i>use</i> of the representation.<br>
Intuitive reflection on sentential structure would treat it as linear and as simply <br>
being composed of a string of words. Reflection, in logic and linguistics, informed by systematic<br>
consideration of sentential use, reveals a hierarchical structure with words forming <br>
phrase units that are not immediately obvious to intuition. Finding representational structure<br>
in perception is parallel. It depends not primarily on introspection of conscious perceptual<br>
images, but on systematic reflection on the capacities evinced in uses and <br>
transformations of perceptions. This reflection must consider the representational functions<br>
of perception and the structures of capacities discovered in empirical science. Most of <br>
what there is to be understood about perception is unconscious. All operations that lead to <br>
perceptions are unconscious, and there are many unconscious perceptions. Moreover, given <br>
the way in which perceptual discriminative capacities, and their use in guiding action, are <br>
molded, in evolution and learning, by perceiver-needs and by frequently unobvious causal <br>
and statistical patterns in the environment, one cannot rely on introspection of images, <br>
and intuitive types of image-similarity to understand perception—even the iconic, broadly <br>
image-like character of vision. Perceptual grouping does not in general conform to intuitive <br>
image-similarity. Yet all perceptual groupings are grounded, at least partly, in shape-sizemotion<br>
attributions, plotted iconically in an image-like way in perceptual representation.preface xiii</div>
