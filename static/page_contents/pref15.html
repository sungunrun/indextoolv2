distinguish perception, at least by some cases, from just any sensing. And one must be able <br>
to recognize various examples of perception. Detailed philosophical understanding <br>
requires reflection, articulation, and elaboration of a minimal understanding of the concept<br>
perception and of relations between perception and other matters—semantical, functional,<br>
biological, causal, and so on. Given an elaborated understanding of what perception <br>
<i>is</i>, it is possible to draw, apriori, some further conclusions about the form, semantics, and <br>
functions of perceptual states. Such conclusions are abstract and limited. They are im portant<br>
because they are foundational.<br>
<br>
Again, most of the book’s claims are empirical. For example, the accounts of how perceptual<br>
and perceptual-motor systems work in Parts III and IV, and the accounts of what <br>
these systems <i>are</i> in Part IV, are warranted partly by appeal to explanations in the science. <br>
Those accounts and those explanations are certainly empirically, not apriori, warranted.<br>
<br>
I became interested in perception partly because it promises insight into basic types of <br>
<i>representation</i> of the world, and partly because it is a key factor that must be understood if <br>
one is to understand empirical <i>knowledge</i>. This book shows some fruits of the first mo tivation.<br>
In investigating the structure and semantics of perceptual representation, one investigates<br>
primitive and basic types of reference and attribution. My interest in the role of <br>
perception in empirical knowledge remains. But I take understanding perception to owe <br>
almost nothing to epistemology, whereas understanding epistemology absolutely requires <br>
understanding perception. Epistemology investigates epistemic norms for capacities that <br>
can contribute to obtaining knowledge. One cannot understand the norms without understanding<br>
the capacities. One understands perceptual capacities by reflecting on empirical <br>
science and its basic commitments, not by reflecting on epistemology. Understanding perception<br>
is the task of this book. Epistemic use of an understanding of perception is pos terior.<br>
For  epistemic work in this direction, see my ‘Perceptual Entitlement’, <i>Philosophy and <br>
Phenomenological Research</i> 67 (2003), 503–548; and ‘Entitlement: The Basis for Empirical <br>
Warrant’, in P. Graham and N. Pedersen eds., <i>Epistemic Entitlement</i> (Oxford: Oxford <br>
University Press, 2020).<br>
<br>
I have some slight hope, even in this specialized world, that this book will interest not <br>
only philosophers, but at least some scientists in perceptual psychology and other areas of <br>
psychology. The best science is informed by a breadth and depth of perspective that <i>is</i> <br>
philosophical. This point is particularly relevant to perceptual psychology. A central, often <br>
stated, aim of the science is to understand conditions in which accurate perception occurs, <br>
and conditions under which illusions occur. (See Chapter 1, note 25.) Accuracy is a <br>
semantical concept.<br>
<br>
So the science is committed at its very core to there being a semantics for perception—a <br>
systematic account of relations between perceptual representation and its subject matters. <br>
The account must explain what it is for perception to be accurate or inaccurate. Of course, <br>
the science is mainly concerned with causal patterns and mechanisms. Much of it, indeed <br>
probably most of it to date, focuses on <i>pre</i>-representational, <i>pre</i>-perceptual states that <br>
regis ter the proximal stimulus. But the point of this scientific work is partly to build <br>
toward understanding perception of the physical environment. Part of understanding perception<br>
scientifically is to understand not only the causal patterns that lead to accurate <br>
and inaccurate perception, but also to understand the form and content of perceptual <br>
states, and what it is for them to be accurate or inaccurate.preface xv</div>
