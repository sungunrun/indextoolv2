accurate and inaccurate perceptual states are formed. It has, however, paid little attention <br>
to explaining what it is for such states to be accurate or inaccurate, or to reflecting on how <br>
representational capacities combine to yield a form of representation. Nor have these <br>
issues been related to the obvious iconic nature of perceptual representation. I take steps <br>
toward remedying this situation. In the course of doing so, I think that I have discovered <br>
some basic aspects of <i>attribution</i>, the root of <i>predication</i>. Predication in language and <br>
thought has been a longstanding topic of philosophical reflection, beginning with Aristotle <br>
and Kant, and developing mainly in Frege, but also in Tarski and Strawson. Traditionally, <br>
the topic has been pursued by reflection on logic. I have found it enlightening to reflect on <br>
its roots in perception.<br>
<br>
The second type of <i>first form</i> of representational mind is the first-formed states in the <br>
order of perceptual processing. What is the nature of the perceptual states that are formed <br>
fastest? What properties in the environment do they represent? What sort of processing <br>
leads to them? There are empirical answers to these questions, at least for mammalian <br>
vision. These answers provide a starting point for reflecting on what the fastest-formed <br>
perceptual states are like in lower animals and even in evolutionary history. Of course, <br>
each species must be considered on its own. I do not much discuss lower animals, nor do I <br>
provide an evolutionary account, although I occasionally comment on those topics. This <br>
second type of first form is center-stage in Chapters 10–11. Issues about later-formed perceptual<br>
representations, such as those used in perceptual recognition of individuals, and <br>
perhaps for causation, agency, and functional attributes, such as <i>mate</i> or <i>edible</i>, are <br>
touched on in Chapter 12.<br>
<br>
The third type of <i>first form</i> of representational mind is a natural-kind system of representational<br>
capacities, with perception at the representational center of the system. The <br>
systems that I highlight are the visual-perceptual system and the visuomotor system. <br>
The two systems intersect and overlap. What it is to be part of these systems is the <br>
 central theme of Part IV, Chapters 13–19. I believe that perception shares its representational<br>
structure and content, outlined in Chapters 2–12, with several other representational <br>
capacities. Generically, the capacities are conation, attention-initiation, memory, affect, <br>
learning, anticipation, and imagining. I think that the listed <i>generic</i> capacities have <br>
<i>perceptual-level species—</i>species that have representational structures and contents that are <br>
essentially those of perception. These capacities differ from perception in mode (<i>memory</i> <br>
vs. <i>perception</i>) and transition-operations, not in form or content. The notion of representational<br>
<i>level</i> is explained in Chapter 1, the section The Principal Aims of the Book <br>
and again, more fully, at the beginning of Chapter 13.<br>
<br>
Perceptual-level species of the listed capacities share attributional content with perception.<br>
They share attributional and iconic structure with perception. And they involve <br>
operations or transformations that are either similar to those in perception-formation <br>
itself, or at least not more sophisticated than they are. These sub-species join with perception<br>
to form two large, natural-kind psychological systems—the perceptual system and <br>
the perceptual-motor system. These systems are unified (a) in sharing a <i>function</i> (contributing<br>
to perception in the first case, contributing to perceptually guided action in the second),<br>
and (b) in sharing the representational <i>structure</i> of perception. They are also unified <br>
(c) in using only representational attributive <i>contents</i> in or borrowed from perception; <br>
and (d) in being held together by <i>computational</i> causal processes both within perception <br>
and between perception and the perceptual-level species of the listed generic capacities. xii preface</div>
