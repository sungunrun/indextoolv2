proposals abound. Perhaps it was always so. However, as knowledge grows—and grows <br>
more complex—lack of patience in pursuing understanding is an increasingly debilitating <br>
vice. Given that philosophical understanding of this book’s topics has become harder—<br>
because more is known and what is known is more complex—patience is more required <br>
than ever.<br>
<br>
For those who may have some interest in the book, but are not initially willing to invest <br>
large of amounts of time in it, I set out a plan for getting some of the book’s gist. My hope <br>
is that after achieving an overview, some readers will be tempted to go back for more—not <br>
just noting fine points, but mastering the book’s conceptual framework and conceptual <br>
intricacies.<br>
<br>
For vision scientists, Parts I–II deal with the least familiar ideas—principally, the representational<br>
form and semantics of perception. Part III and Chapters 13–18 in Part IV <br>
mainly describe matters that many vision or visuomotor scientists are familiar with, <br>
although they cast those matters in a conceptual form that may be more unified than specialized<br>
accounts provide. Chapter 19 of Part IV, supported by Chapters 13–18, presents a <br>
large view of the visual system and visuomotor system that uses perhaps familiar em piric<br>
al materials to develop a possibly less familiar, or more sharply articulated, view of those <br>
systems as wholes.<br>
<br>
For those, either vision scientists or others, who simply want to get a sense for the main <br>
lines of thought, I offer the following, tentative guide.<br>
<br>
I recommend, in Part I, the first two sections of Chapter 1 and all of Chapter 2. In <br>
Chapter 3, I recommend the prologue and the section Retinal Image Contour <br>
Registration and Surface Contour Perception. This section illustrates concretely<br>
how I think perceptual constancies are distinguished from other invariances in <br>
visual perception.<br>
<br>
In Part II, I recommend the prologue at the beginning of Chapter 4, and the third and <br>
fifth sections of the chapter (Representational-Dependence Hierarchies in <br>
Perceptual Attribution and Taxonomic Hierarchies in Perception). In <br>
Chapter 5, I recommend the first two sections (Basic Form of Perceptual <br>
Contents and Perceptual Reference is Partly Guided by Perceptual <br>
Attribution). In Chapter 6, I recommend the first three and the last of the sections <br>
(Review of Basic Form of Perceptual Representation; Perception of <br>
Property Instances; Betokening and Four Types of Perceptual <br>
Attribution; and Perceptual Contents, Propositions, and Noun <br>
Phrase). Chapter 7 gives the central account of the semantics of perception. This may be <br>
hard to follow if one has skipped too much of the slow development of concepts that lead <br>
up to it. The key section is the next-to-last one (Accuracy Conditions for <br>
Perceptual Attributives in Perceptual Constancies). Chapter 8 centers <br>
on the way space and time are represented in visual perception. It can be skipped by those <br>
not interested in details of perceptual representational structure. Chapter 9 connects basic <br>
representational structure (the structure of reference and attribution) with the iconic form <br>
of visual perception. The key sections are the first and the last two (Noun-Phrase-Like <br>
Structure and Iconic Representation in Perception; Relations <br>
Between Iconic Format and Representational Content; and The <br>
Tractability of Iconic Attributional Complexity).preface xvii</div>
